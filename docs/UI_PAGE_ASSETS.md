# UI Page Assets

CredTrail server-rendered pages should keep route handlers focused on orchestration and move presentation assets (CSS/JS) into typed page asset modules.

## Goals

- Keep route files focused on auth, validation, and data loading.
- Keep page renderer modules focused on HTML structure + view model mapping.
- Serve CSS/JS from stable asset URLs with long-lived caching.

## Asset Registry

Page assets are registered in `apps/api-worker/src/ui/page-assets/index.ts`.

- Every asset has:
  - `kind` (`style` or `script`)
  - `stem` (human-readable name)
  - `contentType`
  - `body`
- Public paths are content-hashed under `/assets/ui/*`.
- Asset responses are served with:
  - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
  - explicit `Content-Type`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

## Usage

In page renderer modules, import and include asset tags in `renderPageShell(..., headContent)`:

- `renderPageAssetTags([...])`
- `pageStylesheetTag(...)`
- `pageScriptTag(...)`

Example pages using this pattern:

- Magic link login page
- Institution admin dashboard page
- LTI launch/deep-link/issuer pages

Shared foundation asset:

- `foundationCss` provides design tokens, Shoelace theme variable mapping, and layout utility classes:
  - `.ct-stack`
  - `.ct-cluster`
  - `.ct-grid`
  - `.ct-grid--sidebar`
  - `.ct-card`

## Inline CSS/JS Policy

Avoid large inline `<style>` and `<script>` blocks.

Allowed inline content:

- Tiny, page-specific critical snippets (prefer < 10 lines)
- JSON context blobs for external scripts (e.g. `<script type="application/json">`)

Not allowed inline content:

- Full page stylesheets
- Large behavior scripts
- Reused styles/scripts duplicated across routes

Token/layout guidance:

- Prefer semantic page classes for page personality.
- Prefer foundation tokens/utilities for spacing, radius, elevation, and layout primitives.
- Avoid introducing Tailwind-like utility sprawl; keep utilities few and predictable.

## Ownership

- Route handlers own request orchestration and security checks.
- Page renderers own HTML structure.
- `ui/page-assets` owns CSS/JS delivery and cache strategy.
